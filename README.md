## :scroll: Description
 Weather App - It is a simple weather app built using JetPack Compose. Weather App contains Light and Dark Theme and features Hot and Cool Clr Theme which Changes Depending on the Temperature.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
 This is the first time i have implemented 4 themes for a app and the theme changes depending on the current temperature displayed.
 This Ui is inspired from a dribble post and is improvised by none other than me.
